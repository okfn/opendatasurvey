timetables,Transport Timetables,Transport,"Timetables of major government operated (or commissioned) *national-level* public transport services (specifically bus and train). The focus here is on national level services (not those which operate *only* at a municipal or city level and which are not controlled or regulated by the national government). A 'yes' in any question will refer to both types of transport. However, if there is no national level service operated or regulated by the government for a given type of transport (for instance busses), then this type is ignored in this data category.",
budget,Government Budget,Finance,"National government budget at a high level (e.g. spending by sector, department etc). This category is about *budgets* which are government *plans* for expenditure (not actual expenditure in the past).",
spending,Government Spending,Finance,Records of actual (past) national government spending at a detailed transactional level; at the level of month to month government expenditure on specific items (usually this means individual records of spending amounts under $1m or even under $100k). (Note: Just a database of contracts awarded or similar is *not* considered sufficient. This data category refers to detailed ongoing data on *actual* expenditure),

postcodes,Postcodes / Zipcodes,Geodata,A database of postcodes/zipcodes and the corresponding geospatial locations in terms of a latitude and a longitude (or similar co-ordinates in an openly published national co-ordinate system).  A database which gives a location in terms of the name of a town or a street without lat/long co-ordinates is not considered acceptable unless the name of the town or street can be further converted to a latitude and longitude by means of other open data (eg an open gazetteer with latitude and longitude attributes).,
emissions,Emissions of pollutants,Environment,"Aggregate data about the emission of air pollutants especially those potentially harmful to human health (although it is not a requirement to include information on green house gas emissions).
